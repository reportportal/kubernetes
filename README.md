Kubernetes/Helm configs for ReportPortal

This Helm project is created to setup ReportPortal with only one commando.  
The help chart is tested on Minikube and creates a fully working ReportPortal project

**Do note that this is a Beta version**

The chart installs all mandatory services to run ReportPortal

The Helm chart installation consist of the following .yaml files:

- Statefulset and Service files of: `Analyzer, Api, Elasticsearch, Gateway, Index, Mongodb, Registry, UAT, UI` that are used for deployment and communication between services.
- PersistentVolume files: `Elasticsearch, Mongodb, Registry`
- A `Ingress` to access the UI
- A `values.yaml` which exposes a few of the configuration options in the
charts.
- A `templates/_helpers.tpl` file which contains helper templates. 


You can deploy this chart with `helm install ./<project folder>`. 

Once it's installed please make sure that the PersistentVolumes directories are created

Commando to create those folders:
- `minikube ssh`
- `sudo mkdir /mnt/data/db`
- `sudo mkdir /mnt/data/console`
- `sudo mkdir /mnt/data/elastic`

Also make sure that the vm.max_map_count is setup
- `minikube ssh`
- `sudo sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144`

The url to reach ReportPortal is http://reportportal.k8.com
Make sure that the url is added in the host file and the ip is the K8 ip address
# For example:
`192.1.1.1	reportportal.k8.com`
